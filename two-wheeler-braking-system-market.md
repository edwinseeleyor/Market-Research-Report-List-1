<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-wheeler Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ABS Braking System</li><li>CBS Braking System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler braking system market primarily features two advanced technologies: Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) and Combined Braking System (CBS). ABS enhances safety by preventing wheel lock-up during hard braking, maintaining steering control and reducing stopping distances. It is particularly beneficial in slippery conditions. On the other hand, CBS optimally distributes braking force between the front and rear wheels when the rider engages either brake lever, promoting stability and control during stopping. Both systems are essential for improving rider safety and overall vehicle performance.</p></p>
